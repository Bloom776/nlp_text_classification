revolut,europe,"I have been using Revolut since 2018 and I manly subscribed to the ""Metal"" plan. I advised the financial institution to many friends, colleagues and family members because it worked fine and the support was good. This all changed during the past 6 months, and it is so bad I decided to close my account. The last drop was the unilateral change of my IBAN from Lithuania to Italy, done without my consent, without giving me any information and from one day to another, which is clearly against European Legislation.
When I asked to close the account and transfer my assets to my regular bank's
IBAN, the answer was that I had to close the account if I wanted to. Of course there were many ""we are sorry, we are here to help, we feel your discomfort"" and similar phrases that just added further anguish.
After 15 days of back and forth communications, I still don't know why this happened, if not for ""adhering to mandatory policies"", to which there is no further information. But this is not atypical, since I still don't know why paying at a gas station in Europe, I was charged in Japanese Yen (they blame of course the merchant). The fact is Revolut has become a source of anguish and I would like to close the account but it seems impossible because I have 5 euros in Cryptos that need first 10 days then 1 month to be sold and after I told them to keep them they said they cannot. Polka dot, if you are out there, since they blame you: why do I need a month to sell your coins?

revolut,Europe,"I have been using Revolut since 2018 and I manly subscribed to the ""Metal"" plan. I advised the financial institution to many friends, colleagues and family members because it worked fine and the support was good. This all changed during the past 6 months, and it is so bad I decided to close my account. The last drop was the unilateral change of my IBAN from Lithuania to Italy, done without my consent, without giving me any information and from one day to another, which is clearly against European Legislation.
When I asked to close the account and transfer my assets to my regular bank's
IBAN, the answer was that I had to close the account if I wanted to. Of course there were many ""we are sorry, we are here to help, we feel your discomfort"" and similar phrases that just added further anguish.
After 15 days of back and forth communications, I still don't know why this happened, if not for ""adhering to mandatory policies"", to which there is no further information. But this is not atypical, since I still don't know why paying at a gas station in Europe, I was charged in Japanese Yen (they blame of course the merchant). The fact is Revolut has become a source of anguish and I would like to close the account but it seems impossible because I have 5 euros in Cryptos that need first 10 days then 1 month to be sold and after I told them to keep them they said they cannot. Polka dot, if you are out there, since they blame you: why do I need a month to sell your coins?

monzo,us,"Simple was special, but like everything special it was violently obliterated by a monster. I've tried almost everything out there and few, if any came close. I used Monzo while living in the UK and, even in its infancy there, it was beautiful. Then it came here and was initially very rough and a far cry from its UK counterpart. It has now caught up and is really quite lovely. However, I have a few shortcoming to note: mobile check deposit (seriously, this should have been a first order feature); second, it needs more than just a mobile app (the iPad copy and paste does not count), at least make a web app you can shove onto the iPad as well; next, please add widgets; also, I had this gripe in the UK too, and that's the card, would it kill you to allow some colour options?; and finally, digital currency support would be nice, MetaMask, Coinbase, whatever, just some level of support would be nice, though I know that's a complicated ask in the US.","simple was special, but like everything special it was violently obliterated by a monster. i've tried almost everything out there and few, if any came close. i used monzo while living in the uk and, even in its infancy there, it was beautiful. then it came here and was initially very rough and a far cry from its uk counterpart. it has now caught up and is really quite lovely. however, i have a few shortcoming to note: mobile check deposit (seriously, this should have been a first order feature); second, it needs more than just a mobile app (the ipad copy and paste does not count), at least make a web app you can shove onto the ipad as well; next, please add widgets; also, i had this gripe in the uk too, and that's the card, would it kill you to allow some colour options?; and finally, digital currency support would be nice, metamask, coinbase, whatever, just some level of support would be nice, though i know that's a complicated ask in the us.",product_&_feature_feedback,4,appstore,Low,176

monzo,unknown,"It's a beautifully designed app, but some of the features don't make sense and there's no documentation about how to use them. I had switched hoping for envelope style budgeting like I had with Simple (and most recently Zeta) but there's no clear way to track all of your bills and manually set money aside for them when you get paid. It's overly automated and some bills are tracked in one feature, others in another, and it's just very hard to determine if you have all your bills covered between paychecks. Especially variable bills that aren't credit cards (like utilities). It could use some simplifying and explaining of the features. Just wish it would let me add an expense and set how much it is and when it's due, and let me set money aside for it.
I'll probably stick with it and just track my bills in a spreadsheet for now, but I'm disappointed to have gone through all this work switching just to have less clarity/ assurance about my bills being accounted for. I thought that was the whole point.","it's a beautifully designed app, but some of the features don't make sense and there's no documentation about how to use them. i had switched hoping for envelope style budgeting like i had with simple (and most recently zeta) but there's no clear way to track all of your bills and manually set money aside for them when you get paid. it's overly automated and some bills are tracked in one feature, others in another, and it's just very hard to determine if you have all your bills covered between paychecks. especially variable bills that aren't credit cards (like utilities). it could use some simplifying and explaining of the features. just wish it would let me add an expense and set how much it is and when it's due, and let me set money aside for it.

monzo,unknown,"I got Monzo for the simple fact that it was promoted as a convenient form of payment option if you planned to travel overseas.
Thanks YouTube. I liked the name also so I applied for it. Once my account was approved and I started seeing all the convenient ways it really helped you budget, set up jars and view your whole financial picture like I have never seen before, I felt empowered. (Plus, I love how I get direct deposit on Tuesday night/Wednesday Morning) Not until they switched up with their new ""Pro"" approach to simply charge me $10 just to allow me to set up additional jars, increase my savings rate to above 3% when it was already above 3% prior the launch of such program. Come up with a better way to fund new products and services. Simply charging customers $10

monzo,unknown,"I originally downloaded this onto my ipad to save space on my phone (200+MB) but later learned that ipad has a separate apple pay wallet so adding there doesn't put the card on my phone wallet. So I deleted that and installed on the iphone but now every time I click to add to apple pay it briefly shows an error message and then goes back to the screen before I clicked to add. Meanwhile it logged me out of the ipad and I have to log back in there too try to add back to ipad wallet. But can't add to ipad wallet either.
Like the option has been removed after one use. Maybe it takes a few days to refresh.

monzo,unknown,"I like the instant funding option - very convenient. Setting certain transactions as repeating payments is a very nice feature for subscriptions and under the ""Payments"" tab you can see these recurring payments. I like that you can add notes, tags and receipts to every transaction. The budgeting tool is not very helpful to me personally, but the Trends feature is - it helps to see how you're using your money. The Pots have a ""scheduled payments"" option, but it should really say
""scheduled transfers"" because Pots are not for making payments - they are just to set money aside. To use money from Pots you have to transfer it back to main account. If I could make payments directly from a ""Bills"" Pot with its own account number then
""scheduled payments"" would make sense and would be a very useful feature. Spend (checking), Savings and Bills - if I had a separate account number for these three along with some cash back or rewards options on purchases, it would be the perfect banking app for me.

monzo,unknown,"As someone who uses Copilot budgeting app, Plaid support is crucial and how my local credit union can have support for Plaid, but a fintech company like Monzo not, is beyond me. I've been using Monzo for the past two months as my primary bank and not being able to use my budgeting app of choice is incredibly frustrating. What worse is that on Monzo's development roadmap, Plaid support falls low on the list and it doesn't seem to be a priority at all. Granted, Monzo has built in budgeting tools, but they pale in comparison to something like Copilot.
So while I'm not going to close my account, l will switch back to my credit union in the mean time.
Aside that, the app has a nice interface and the pots feature is quite nice as well.","as someone who uses copilot budgeting app, plaid support is crucial and how my local credit union can have support for plaid, but a fintech company like monzo not, is beyond me. i've been using monzo for the past two months as my primary bank and not being able to use my budgeting app of choice is incredibly frustrating. what worse is that on monzo's development roadmap, plaid support falls low on the list and it doesn't seem to be a priority at all. granted, monzo has built in budgeting tools, but they pale in comparison to something like copilot.
